        <p id="introText">
            My name is Truphena Okenye, a passionate full-stack developer with a degree in Business Information Technology (BBIT) from JKUAT, graduated in 2023.
             My journey into the world of technology began in Kisii, where I was born and raised by my hardworking single mother alongside my two siblings.
              Being the second born, I’ve always been inspired by the resilience and determination my mother showed in providing for us, despite the challenges we faced. </p>

              <p id="introText">From a young age, I was deeply fascinated by how technology works, particularly how messages are transmitted from one phone to another and how applications are developed. 
This curiosity blossomed during my high school years when I took computer as one of my subjects, earning an A in my KCSE exams.
 This achievement fueled my decision to pursue a computer-related course at university. </p>

 <p id="introText"> My university years were marked by significant achievements and growth. 
 Despite the struggles with financial support from my father, who was physically and emotionally distant, I managed to excel academically and professionally. I worked on numerous projects to monetize my skills, including my first major project—a fully functioning bus booking system integrated with M-Pesa for payments. This project exemplifies my ability to solve real-world problems through technology.
</p>
<p id="introText"> 
Besides having programming skills, I am proficient in using Microsoft Word and Excel, 
as well as design tools like Canva. I have applied these skills in various projects, like designing logos and cards like business cards. This combination of technical and design skills allows me to create visually appealing and functional solutions, whether it's a website, an application, or marketing materials.
</p>
    <p class="hiddenText" style="display: none;"> During my time at university, I took on the role of a lead in the coding club, 
    where I found immense joy in helping others solve problems and sharing my knowledge. 
    This experience reinforced my desire to educate and inspire the next generation of tech enthusiasts. My passion for continuous learning keeps me up-to-date with the latest technological advancements, and I am eager to pass on this knowledge to prepare young minds for the future.
    
   </p>
   <p class="hiddenText" style="display: none;"> 
    In addition to my academic and project work, I gained valuable professional experience as an intern at Niftecs Limited.
     This role taught me the importance of teamwork and effective communication, skills that are crucial in the tech world and even leadership.
   </p>
   <p class="hiddenText" style="display: none;"> 
     I believe in the power of technology to change lives and am committed to being a part of this transformation. I aspire to be a significant contributor to the tech industry, inspiring and mentoring young talents to realize their potential.
